MdCodeBlock
===========

A simple helper for wrapping Github Flavored Markdown Code Block.

Using GFM code block, fenced code block, it's required to keep typing the little backtick (**`**) six times to wrap the code.  And also an optional language identifier for syntax highlighting.

It would be nice if you just need to select the code block, type the syntax highlighting and then it wraps for you to save the typing on backtick.  This is what this helper for.

It's dead simple to select the code, press command shortcut, type the language (optional) in the prompt and done.
