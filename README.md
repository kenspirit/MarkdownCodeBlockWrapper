MarkdownCodeBlockWrapper
===========

A simple helper for wrapping Github Flavored Markdown Code Block.

Using GFM code block, fenced code block, it's required to keep typing the little backtick (**`**) six times to wrap the code.  And also an optional language identifier for syntax highlighting.

It would be nice if you just need to select the code block, press command shortcut, type the optional syntax highlighting language and done.  This helper wraps for you to save the typing on backtick.

_Notes: If you use Command Palette instead of directly using hot-key `ctrl+alt+c` to call up the command, you need to type in `mdcode` instead of full name `Markdown`.  Thanks @sambody for reminder._

Added a code snippets `mdc` so that it's even easier to generate a new code block although `ctrl+alt+c` can enclose existing code with fenced code block.
