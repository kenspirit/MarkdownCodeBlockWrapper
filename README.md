MarkdownCodeBlockWrapper
===========

A simple helper for wrapping Github Flavored Markdown Code Block.

Using GFM code block, fenced code block, it's required to keep typing the little backtick (**`**) six times to wrap the code.  And also an optional language identifier for syntax highlighting.

It would be nice if you just need to select the code block, press command shortcut, type the optional syntax highlighting language and done.  This helper wraps for you to save the typing on backtick.
